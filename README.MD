#Sfall 1, by Crafty#

##A plugin of tweaks/changes/fixes/customizations for the Fallout 1 engine##

Timeslip stopped work on the Fallout 1 version of sfall many years ago. Crafty has picked up where she left off, and added many of the Fallout-2-only features back into the Fallout 1 version.

##Sources##

 - This is a continuation/extension of Timeslip's sfall project located at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sfall/
 - The current Fallout 2 sfall can be found at https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall/

##Compiling##
To properly compile, you may need to have the DirectX SDK installed on the computer.

I have provided the files that I personally needed for compiling in the "Includes" folder of this repo, but if you get errors, grab the SDK from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
